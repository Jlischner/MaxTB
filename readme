This code calculates the hot carrier generation of nanoparticles subject to an external electric field. Fermi's Golden Rule is used to estimate the rate of hot carrier generation, using a quasi-static approximation of the electric field. The perturbing field is taken into account through a complex electric potential. Fermi's Golden Rule is evaluated using a Chebyshev decomposition.

The code is separated into several files:
generate_positions.jl - Creates the position of the atoms inside the nanoparticle
gold.jl - Creates the tight-binding Hamiltonian from the atomic positions already calculated
potential.jl - Creates the perturbation (external electric potential) from scratch, or from a COMSOL file
aux.jl - Contains auxiliary code for the calculation (Chebyshev iteration and resumming is here)
metallic.jl - Puts the previous codes together to get the hot carrier generation rate

Visualization tool: 
vpython_visualizer.py - takes the atomic positions generated by generate_positions.jl and plots them in a 3D graph to check if the nanoparticle is well generated.
