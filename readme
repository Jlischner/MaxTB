--- Hot carrier generation in nanoparticles ---
Main developer: Hanwen Jin
Co-developer: Simão Meneses João

This code calculates the hot carrier generation of nanoparticles subject to an external electric field. Fermi's Golden Rule is used to estimate the rate of hot carrier generation, using a quasi-static approximation of the electric field. The perturbing field is taken into account through a complex electric potential. Fermi's Golden Rule is evaluated using a Chebyshev decomposition.

See the documentation (doc) for an explanation of the code.
